# C++ (starter)

C++ is the first programming language that I have learned.

My IDE for C++ is Code::Blocks but you can use visual studio code as well.
If you want to use Visual studio, you should first download some extensions for C++.

In this repository I wanna put some simple C++ codes.

It's a good language to start studying
