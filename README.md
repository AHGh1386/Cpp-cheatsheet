# C++ (starter)

C++ is the first programming language that I have learned.
My IDE for C++ is Code::Blocks but you can use visual studio code as well.
If you want to use Visual studio, you should first download some extensions for C++.
In this repository I wanna put some simple C++ codes & some simple projects.

It's a good language to start studying but first of all you should know something:

What are static languages?? & what are dynamic languages?

It's so easy!
In static languages before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single variable must be known. Some common examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Java, Haskell, C, C++, C#, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Go, Pascal, and Swift.

In dynamic languages, the types and values are both dynamic, which means the types and values can both be changed. For example, a variable that was previously assigned an integer can be assigned a string. The type checking is done during run time.(in C++ we can not do this.)
