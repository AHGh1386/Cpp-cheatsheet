int main() is our main funtion.

So if you wanna make another funtion , you should first write 
the type (int , char or etc.) after that you should write the 
name of your function. finally write ()

in () you can put variables and you can send the values to
them with another function.

For example in my code i made a function that its name is plus.
I sent two variables to it and then it returned a+b in one
variable. finally i can cout and see the result.
